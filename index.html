                <p>Hey Guys, my name is Karan Sinha. Welcome to my website! I am very excited to start my journey as a software developer. I am very eager to learn how to make mindblowing and beautiful websites and applications (hopefully ones that look better than this one)! Here are few words regarding a topic for which I am the world's leading expert: Myself!
                (Don't mind these words here, they are just a placeholder I am using to take up space so I can get to the next paragraph lol). </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>I graduated from the Catholic University in 2018 with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. I was also a pitcher and captain on the baseball team. Go Cards! Aside from staying up until 4 am every night crying in the library about passing Calc 3 I spent a lot of time hanging out with my friends, listening to music, and wasting my time scrolling through twitter.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>After college ended I began working as a bartender/manager at a whiskey bar on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. while ultimately mulling over my next career options. Rumor has it that I make the best Old Fashioned east of the Mississippi! I can neither confirm nor deny these rumors, however. I have always had a keen interest in computer and software engineering/development and feel as though this is what I want to do for my career. Thank you so much for reading. Cheers!</p>
